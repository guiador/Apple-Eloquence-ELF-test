# 04 — How the converter works

This document walks through `macho2elf/macho2elf.py` for anyone who wants
to understand or modify it. Skip if you just want to use the tool.

## Why this works at all

The lucky alignment that makes this approach tractable:

| Concern | Apple x86_64 | Linux x86_64 | Match? |
|---|---|---|---|
| ABI (calling conv, stack, red zone) | System V AMD64 | System V AMD64 | ✅ Identical |
| Addressing model | PIC + RIP-relative | PIC + RIP-relative | ✅ Identical |
| C++ ABI | Itanium (mangling, vtable layout, exceptions) | Itanium | ✅ Identical |
| Standard C++ runtime | libc++ (`std::__1`) | libc++ (`std::__1`) | ✅ Identical IF you install libc++ |
| C runtime | Darwin libSystem | glibc | ⚠️ ~95% same names, a few renames |
| File format | Mach-O | ELF | ❌ Different — this is what we translate |

Because the executable code itself uses System V calling conventions and
RIP-relative addressing, the **bytes in `__TEXT,__text` are valid on Linux
x86_64 unchanged**. Same for arm64. We don't need to recompile or
binary-rewrite the code; we just need to put it in an ELF wrapper that
the Linux dynamic loader understands.

The same insight wouldn't work for **Windows x64** — MS ABI uses different
argument registers and has shadow space; the bytes would need real
translation at every API call boundary. Or for **32-bit x86** — Apple
hasn't shipped i386 in this era, and the calling convention differs
significantly between System V i386 and Apple's old i386 ABI.

## The strategy

1. **Parse the Mach-O** with LIEF — extract sections, segments, exports,
   imports, bindings, relocations, chained-fixup chains.

2. **Dump each section as a binary blob** to disk (e.g., `TEXT__text.bin`,
   `DATA__data.bin`).

3. **Emit a single assembly stub** that:
   - `.extern` declares every external symbol the dylib imports (with
     Darwin → Linux renaming applied: `___error` → `__errno_location`,
     etc.).
   - For each section, emits an event-interleaved stream of:
     - `.incbin "blob.bin", from, len` for raw byte chunks
     - `.globl <name>` + `.type <name>, @function` + `<name>:` labels
       at every export's offset within the section
     - `.quad <symbol_name>` patches at every chained-fixup binding offset
       (overrides the original 8 bytes)
     - `.quad <section_label> + <offset>` patches at every rebase site
       (these become `R_X86_64_RELATIVE` after linking)
   - Emits an `.init_array` section containing `.quad` references to each
     Mach-O `__init_offsets` initializer (so ld.so runs C++ static
     constructors at load time).
   - Emits a `.note.GNU-stack` section in the `:gnustack` phdr (so the
     loader doesn't request executable stack).

4. **Emit a linker script** that:
   - Pins each ELF section at the original Mach-O virtual address (so
     all the RIP-relative offsets in the original code work unchanged).
   - Places linker-auto-generated sections (`.dynsym`, `.dynstr`,
     `.rela.dyn`, `.dynamic`, etc.) far above the Mach-O image's address
     range so they don't collide.
   - Uses a separate `auxtext` PT_LOAD segment for the linker-auto
     `.plt`/`.text`/`.rodata` sections so they don't extend the main
     text segment's vaddr range into the data segment.

5. **Compile a tiny stubs.c** providing the few Darwin-specific symbols
   that have no direct Linux equivalent:
   - `_macho2elf_rune_locale_stub` — placeholder for Apple's
     `_DefaultRuneLocale` ctype-table global (engine only uses it via
     macros that we map to glibc's `isalpha`/etc.)
   - `__stack_chk_guard` — glibc keeps the canary in TLS (`fs:0x28`)
     and doesn't export the symbol, so we provide a fixed-value global.
   - `__maskrune` — Darwin's ctype bitmask lookup, stubbed via glibc's
     `isalpha`/`isdigit`/etc.

6. **Run `gcc -shared`** with the linker script to produce the final ELF.

## Section layout translation

Mach-O segments and sections don't map 1:1 to ELF. Some have analogs and
some are special:

| Mach-O | ELF equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `__TEXT,__text` | `.text` (we use `.m2e_text`) | Code |
| `__TEXT,__stubs` | `.plt`-equivalent (we keep as `.m2e_stubs`) | Indirect-jump trampolines |
| `__TEXT,__cstring` | `.rodata.str1` | C string constants |
| `__TEXT,__const` | `.rodata` | Read-only data |
| `__TEXT,__gcc_except_tab` | `.gcc_except_table` | C++ exception LSDA (DWARF format, portable) |
| `__TEXT,__unwind_info` | (no ELF equivalent — Apple's compact unwind) | We just `.incbin` it; not used by glibc unwinder |
| `__TEXT,__init_offsets` | `.init_array` (regenerated) | Static constructor pointers |
| `__DATA_CONST,__got` | `.got` (we keep as `.m2e_got`) | External symbol GOT |
| `__DATA_CONST,__const` | `.data.rel.ro` | RW-then-RO data (vtables, typeinfo) |
| `__DATA,__data` | `.data` | RW data |
| `__DATA,__bss` | `.bss` | Zero-initialized |
| `__DATA,__common` | `.bss` | C "common" symbols |
| `__DATA,__got_weak` | `.got` (weak slots) | Weak external imports |
| `__DATA,__const_weak` | `.data.rel.ro` | Weak vtable/typeinfo |

We preserve the original Mach-O virtual address for each section so the
existing RIP-relative offsets in code (and the offsets baked into the
`__stubs` section pointing at `__got` slots) all resolve correctly. The
linker script's `. = vaddr` assignments do this.

## Symbol translation

Mach-O prepends an underscore to every C/C++ symbol. ELF does not. So
`_atoi` in Mach-O becomes `atoi` in ELF — just strip one leading
underscore.

A handful of Darwin libc functions don't exist on Linux with the same
name:

| Mach-O name (stripped) | Linux equivalent | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `__error` | `__errno_location` | Different errno-accessor function name |
| `__tolower` | `tolower` | Darwin has `__tolower(c)`; glibc only has `tolower(c)` |
| `__toupper` | `toupper` | Same |
| `__stderrp` | `stderr` | Darwin's stdio uses `FILE *__stderrp`; glibc uses `FILE *stderr` |
| `__stdoutp` | `stdout` | Same pattern |
| `__stdinp` | `stdin` | Same pattern |
| `_DefaultRuneLocale` | `_macho2elf_rune_locale_stub` (provided in stubs.c) | Darwin ctype table has no glibc equivalent |

C++ ABI symbols (Itanium mangling: `_ZN...`) work identically on both
platforms — Apple uses libc++ with `std::__1` inline namespace, which is
exactly what Linux libc++ provides too. Hence the strict libc++ linkage
on the Linux side (libstdc++ would NOT work — different namespace, different
mangling).

## Chained-fixup handling

Mach-O on iOS 13+ / macOS 11+ uses *chained fixups* instead of the older
`dyld_info` rebase/bind streams. The fixup data is encoded inline in the
data sections: each 8-byte slot in `__got`, `__const`, etc. contains a
bitfield with the target address (for rebases) or import ordinal (for
binds) plus a "next chain entry offset" field.

LIEF abstracts both formats and gives us:
- `binary.bindings` — iterator of binding sites (slot address + symbol
  reference), but only for the standard binding chains
- `binary.relocations` — comprehensive iterator covering ALL fixup sites
  including internal-symbol relocations that aren't in `binary.bindings`,
  each with `.address` (the slot) and `.target` (the resolved address)

Our converter walks both lists:
- For each `binding` (external symbol reference) → emit `.quad <symbol_name>`
  at the slot. The linker treats this as an undefined reference and
  generates an R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT (or _RELATIVE) at load time.
- For each `relocation` not in `bindings` → emit `.quad <section_label>
  + <offset_within_section>` at the slot. This compiles to R_X86_64_64,
  which the linker turns into R_X86_64_RELATIVE for shared library output.
  ld.so applies the load-time slide.

The result is that every chained-fixup slot in the original Mach-O gets
a corresponding ELF dynamic relocation that does the same thing.

## Why arm64 is harder

The strategy works for arm64 too — same ABI alignment, same Mach-O
structure. The converter is arch-aware (`ARCH_CONFIG` dict at top of
`macho2elf.py`) and emits the right `OUTPUT_FORMAT`, page size, and
toolchain commands.

But there are arm64-specific gotchas, each handled by the converter:
1. **Page alignment**: Apple's arm64 dylibs use 16KB segments
   (`-z max-page-size=0x4000`). x86_64 uses 4KB.
2. **Comment syntax**: arm64 GAS uses `//` for line comments (`#` is for
   immediate values like `mov x0, #4`). x86_64 GAS uses `#`. We use
   block `/* */` comments everywhere to sidestep this.
3. **libc++ availability**: aarch64 cross-toolchain sysroots don't ship
   libc++. We generate empty stub .so files at link time so DT_NEEDED
   gets recorded; ld.so resolves real symbols at load on the target.
   The stubs are linked under `--no-as-needed` — otherwise, exporting no
   symbols, they'd be dropped from DT_NEEDED and the `.so` would have no
   libc++ dependency at all (its C++ symbols, including `_Unwind_Resume`
   via libc++abi → libgcc_s, would be unresolved and `dlopen` would fail).
4. **`--unresolved-symbols=ignore-all`**: for arm64 we tell the linker
   not to fail on unresolved C++ vtable/typeinfo references — they'll
   resolve at load against the target's libc++.
5. **high8 tagged-pointer rebases**: arm64 chained-fixup rebases may set a
   `high8` tag in the pointer's top byte (top-byte-ignore tagged pointers).
   LIEF reports it in bits 56..63 of `r.target`; the converter strips it for
   section lookup and folds it back into the emitted addend. Missing this
   dropped the rebase and left raw fixup bytes (garbage pointers) in the slot.
6. **Variadic ABI**: Apple passes *all* variadic args on the stack; AAPCS64
   passes the first ones in registers. Calls into libc variadic functions
   (`sprintf`, `printf`, `fprintf`, `sscanf`, …) are redirected to asm
   trampolines in `stubs.c` that rebuild a stack-only `va_list` and forward to
   the `v*` variant. See `VARIADIC_SHIMS` / `VARIADIC_TRAMPOLINES_ARM64`.
7. **`__chkstk_darwin`**: Apple's large-frame stack probe, emitted in arm64
   prologues. Provided as a register-preserving no-op stub (Linux grows the
   thread stack on demand).

With these in place, arm64 output synthesizes the same audio as x86_64
(verified under qemu-user: identical sample counts, deviation ~0.01% of peak
from floating-point rounding). See `docs/05-troubleshooting.md`.

## Important subtleties

- **C++ static constructors**: Mach-O's `__init_offsets` lists offsets to
  initializer functions. We translate to ELF `.init_array` so ld.so runs
  them BEFORE any dlopen call returns. If we skipped this, every C++
  global with a non-trivial constructor would be in an unconstructed
  state, and the first method call would crash.

- **Stack canary**: glibc's `__stack_chk_guard` is internal-hidden. We
  must provide our own — see `stubs.c`. The value doesn't matter for
  security (we just want entry-canary == exit-canary), but Apple's
  convention is to make the high byte zero so string-overflow attacks
  hit a null terminator. We follow that pattern.

- **PHDRS overlap**: Mach-O packs sections tighter than ELF segments
  allow. Specifically, `__DATA_CONST` and `__DATA` are at adjacent
  virtual addresses with the same R-then-RO permission profile in
  Mach-O, but ELF wants distinct PT_LOAD segments per permission. We
  unify them into one rwdata PT_LOAD (matching ELF's `.data.rel.ro`
  semantics) to avoid segment-overlap errors.

- **`_DefaultRuneLocale` size**: our stub is an 8KB zero buffer. Apple's
  real struct has classification tables for full Unicode characters. The
  ETI Eloquence engine only seems to use the table via inlined `isXXX(c)`
  macros for ASCII chars, which on glibc go through the function-form
  (`isalpha(c)` etc.) instead — our `__maskrune` stub handles that.
  If something exotic uses the table directly on non-ASCII, we'd need a
  real classification table.

## Limitations / what won't work

- Any Mach-O dylib with Apple-framework dependencies (CoreFoundation,
  Foundation, AVFoundation, etc.) — those have no Linux equivalents.
- arm64e (pointer-authenticated) Mach-O — uses extra encoding bits in
  the chained-fixup format that our converter doesn't decode.
- Objective-C-heavy binaries — Apple's runtime is not on Linux.
- Anything using XPC, Mach ports, or Darwin-only syscalls.
- 32-bit Mach-O (i386 or armv7) — extensively tested only on 64-bit.

The ETI Eloquence dylibs happen to fit cleanly within these limits
because the engine was authored in portable C/C++ to ship across many
platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux, embedded RTOSes) — it's explicitly
designed to use only standard libc and libc++.
